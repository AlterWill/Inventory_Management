# Inventory Management System

A comprehensive inventory management software for small businesses built with Java Swing, FlatLaf, and PostgreSQL.

## Features

### For Employees:
- **Product Management**: Add, edit, and delete products with details like name, description, category, price, and stock levels
- **Transaction Recording**: Record sales, purchases, and returns with automatic stock updates
- **Tax Calculation**: Automatic 10% tax calculation on sales
- **Low Stock Alerts**: Visual indicators for products running low on stock
- **Reports**: View total sales, tax collected, and low stock items

### For Administrators:
- **All Employee Features** plus:

- **Dashboard**: Overview with statistics cards showing total products, sales, employees, and low stock items
- **Advanced Reports**: Net revenue calculations and comprehensive business analytics
- **Full System Control**: Complete access to all inventory operations

### üÜï Automatic Fallback Mode:
- **No Database? No Problem!**: Application automatically switches to in-memory storage if PostgreSQL is unavailable
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box for testing without database setup
- **Seamless Operation**: All features work identically in both modes
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear warnings when running in fallback mode
- **Perfect for Testing**: Test the application without database installation

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Java 24
- **GUI Framework**: Java Swing with FlatLaf Dark theme
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (with in-memory fallback)
- **JDBC**: Direct JDBC for database operations
- **Build Tool**: Maven

## Prerequisites

### For Full Database Mode:
1. Java JDK 24 or higher
2. PostgreSQL database server
3. Maven

### For Testing/Fallback Mode:
1. Java JDK 24 or higher
2. Maven
3. *(No database required!)*

## Database Setup

### Option 1: PostgreSQL (Persistent Storage)

1. Install PostgreSQL on your system
2. Create a database named `inventory_db`:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE inventory_db;
   ```

3. Update database credentials in `Database.java` if needed:
   - Default URL: `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/inventory_db`
   - Default User: `postgres`
   - Default Password: `postgres`

### Option 2: In-Memory Mode (Testing)

Simply run the application! If PostgreSQL is not available or the connection fails, the application will automatically:
- Switch to **in-memory storage mode**
- Display clear warnings
- Function normally with all features
- **Note**: Data will not be persisted between sessions

## Installation & Running

1. Clone or download the project

2. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean compile
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java
   ```

**What happens on startup:**
- Application attempts to connect to PostgreSQL
- If successful: Uses database for persistent storage
- If failed: Automatically switches to in-memory mode with a warning message

## Default Login Credentials

**Admin Account:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

After logging in as admin, you can create employee accounts.

## Fallback Mode Details

### When Fallback Mode Activates:
- PostgreSQL is not installed
- Database server is not running
- Connection credentials are incorrect
- Database doesn't exist
- Network issues prevent connection

### Visual Indicators:
1. **Console Output**: Clear warning message with "‚ö†" symbol
2. **Login Screen**: Orange warning banner showing "IN-MEMORY MODE"
3. **Login Success**: Warning message about data not being persisted

### Fallback Mode Features:
‚úÖ All functionality works identically
‚úÖ User authentication and management
‚úÖ Product CRUD operations
‚úÖ Transaction processing with stock updates
‚úÖ Reports and analytics
‚úÖ Tax calculations
‚ùå Data is NOT saved when application closes
‚ùå No persistence between sessions

### Use Cases for Fallback Mode:
- **Quick Testing**: Test the application without database setup
- **Development**: Rapid development and debugging
- **Demonstrations**: Show application features without infrastructure
- **Training**: Train staff without affecting production data
- **Offline Work**: Work when database is temporarily unavailable

## Database Schema

The application automatically creates the following tables:

### users
- id (PRIMARY KEY)
- username (UNIQUE)
- password
- full_name
- role (ADMIN/EMPLOYEE)
- created_at
- is_active

### products
- id (PRIMARY KEY)
- name
- description
- category
- price
- stock_quantity
- minimum_stock
- created_at

- product_id (FOREIGN KEY)
- user_id (FOREIGN KEY)
- transaction_type (SALE/PURCHASE/RETURN)
- quantity
- price_per_unit
- total_amount
- tax_amount
- transaction_date
- notes

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running
- Verify database name, username, and password in `Database.java`
- Check if PostgreSQL is listening on port 5432

### Compilation Errors
- Ensure Java 24 is installed: `java -version`
- Clean and rebuild: `mvn clean install`

### UI Issues
- FlatLaf theme should load automatically
- If UI looks incorrect, check FlatLaf dependency in `pom.xml`

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:
- Password encryption
- User roles and permissions
- Product barcode scanning
- Invoice generation
- Export reports to PDF/Excel
- Multi-warehouse support
